## Instructions

this project have an unordered list navigation bar tht created dynamically according to the number of sections

i tried to use one forEach loop and put most of the code on it to increase performance and reduce time

i used  2 events
the first one used mouse click to scroll to the desired section
the second one used scroll to give an active class layout to the visible sections.
